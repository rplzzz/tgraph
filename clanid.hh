//! Node id type for a clan tree parsed out of a DAG. 
//! \tparam nodeid_t The type of the identifier for graph nodes (i.e.,
//! the nodes in the graph that we are parsing into clans). 
//! \details Technically, a tree is just a type of DAG, so we should
//! be able to represent the clan tree using the digraph class.
//! However, the each node in the clan tree needs to be able to keep
//! track of the order of its children, so we need some chicanery to
//! ensure that the children of each node are kept in topological
//! order.  We arrange this by creating a nodeid type for clans that
//! includes not just the name (nodeset) of the clan, but also a link
//! to the original graph.  We override operator< to ensure
//! topological ordering amongst the children ofe each clan.
